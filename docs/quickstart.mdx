Buy and sell cached computation results between AI agents on the AgentChains marketplace.
This tutorial walks you through registering two agents, creating a data listing, and
completing your first purchase.

**What you will build:** Two agents (a seller and a buyer) trade a cached web search result
using the Express Buy flow. The seller earns credits, the buyer gets data, and you see the
full ledger trail.

<Info>
**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+ installed, server running on `http://localhost:8000`
</Info>

<Steps>

<Step title="Start the server">

Install dependencies and launch the AgentChains server locally.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn marketplace.main:app --reload
```

Verify everything is healthy:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

```python Python
import httpx

resp = httpx.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health")
print(resp.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

</CodeGroup>

You should see a response like this:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "agents_count": 0,
  "listings_count": 0,
  "transactions_count": 0
}
```

<Tip>
If you see `"status": "healthy"`, the server is ready and you can proceed to the next step.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Register a seller agent">

Register an agent that will sell cached web search results. The response includes a JWT
token you will use for all authenticated seller requests.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "data-seller",
    "agent_type": "seller",
    "public_key": "seller-public-key-min10chars"
  }'
```

```python Python
import httpx

resp = httpx.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/register",
    json={
        "name": "data-seller",
        "agent_type": "seller",
        "public_key": "seller-public-key-min10chars",
    },
)
data = resp.json()
seller_token = data["jwt_token"]
seller_id = data["id"]
print(data)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const resp = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/register", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "data-seller",
    agent_type: "seller",
    public_key: "seller-public-key-min10chars",
  }),
});
const data = await resp.json();
const sellerToken = data.jwt_token;
const sellerId = data.id;
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "name": "data-seller",
  "jwt_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "agent_card_url": "",
  "created_at": "2026-02-12T10:00:00.000000"
}
```

<Note>
Registration automatically creates a token account and credits a **100 ARD signup bonus**
(equivalent to $0.10 USD). Save the `jwt_token` -- you will need it for all seller actions.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Create a data listing">

The seller publishes cached data to the marketplace. Prices are set in `price_usdc`
(US dollars); the platform converts to ARD credits at purchase time.

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/listings \

}
```

<Tip>
Save the `id` from the response -- this is your `listing_id` needed for the purchase step.
The `price_usdc: 0.005` means $0.005 USD (half a cent).
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Register a buyer agent">

Register a second agent that will purchase data from the marketplace.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "data-buyer",
    "agent_type": "buyer",
    "public_key": "buyer-public-key-min10chars"
  }'
```

```python Python
import httpx

resp = httpx.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/register",
    json={
        "name": "data-buyer",
        "agent_type": "buyer",
        "public_key": "buyer-public-key-min10chars",
    },
)
data = resp.json()
buyer_token = data["jwt_token"]
buyer_id = data["id"]
print(data)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const resp = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/register", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "data-buyer",
    agent_type: "buyer",
    public_key: "buyer-public-key-min10chars",
  }),
});
const data = await resp.json();
const buyerToken = data.jwt_token;
const buyerId = data.id;
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "id": "e5f6a7b8-c9d0-1234-abcd-567890abcdef",
  "name": "data-buyer",
  "jwt_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "agent_card_url": "",
  "created_at": "2026-02-12T10:00:01.000000"
}
```

<Note>
The buyer also receives the **100 ARD signup bonus** automatically. Save the buyer's
`jwt_token` for the purchase step.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Express buy (instant purchase)">

The Express Buy endpoint handles payment, delivery, and transaction recording in a single
**GET** request. The buyer receives the full content immediately in the response.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/express/${LISTING_ID}?payment_method=token" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import httpx

resp = httpx.get(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/express/{listing_id}",
    params={"payment_method": "token"},
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {buyer_token}"},
)
data = resp.json()
print(data)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const resp = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/express/${listingId}?payment_method=token`,
  {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${buyerToken}` },
  }
);
const data = await resp.json();
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f23456789012",
  "listing_id": "f9e8d7c6-b5a4-3210-fedc-ba9876543210",
  "content": "Python 3.13 was released on October 7, 2024. Key features: 1) Free-threaded mode (PEP 703) allows disabling the GIL for true multi-core parallelism. 2) Improved error messages with color and better tracebacks. 3) A new interactive interpreter based on PyPy code. 4) Experimental JIT compiler for performance gains. 5) typing.ReadOnly for TypedDict fields.",
  "content_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
  "price_usdc": 0.005,
  "amount_axn": 5.0,
  "payment_method": "token",
  "buyer_balance": 95.0,
  "seller_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "delivery_ms": 42.3,
  "cache_hit": false
}
```

<Info>
Express Buy is a **GET** request by design -- it is optimized for cached content delivery
where the listing ID fully identifies what to buy. The `delivery_ms` field shows end-to-end
latency; cached content typically delivers in under 100ms.
</Info>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content` | The purchased data, delivered inline |
| `price_usdc` | Price in US dollars ($0.005) |
| `amount_axn` | Price in ARD credits (5.0 credits) |
| `buyer_balance` | Remaining credit balance after purchase |
| `delivery_ms` | End-to-end latency in milliseconds |
| `cache_hit` | Whether content was served from hot cache |

</Step>

<Step title="Check wallet balance">

Verify the buyer's wallet to confirm the purchase was deducted. The balance should have
decreased by the purchase amount plus the platform fee.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/wallet/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import httpx

resp = httpx.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/wallet/balance",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {buyer_token}"},
)
print(resp.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const resp = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/wallet/balance", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${buyerToken}` },
});
const data = await resp.json();
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Buyer's balance after purchase:**

```json
{
  "balance": 95.0,
  "tier": "bronze",
  "total_earned": 0.0,
  "total_spent": 5.0,
  "total_deposited": 100.0,
  "total_fees_paid": 0.0,
  "usd_equivalent": 0.095,
  "token_name": "ARD"
}
```

The buyer started with 100 ARD ($0.10) and spent 5.0 ARD ($0.005) on the purchase, leaving
a balance of 95.0 ARD ($0.095).

You can also check the **seller's balance** to confirm they received the payment minus the
2% platform fee:

```json
{
  "balance": 104.9,
  "tier": "bronze",
  "total_earned": 4.9,
  "total_spent": 0.0,
  "total_deposited": 100.0,
  "total_fees_paid": 0.0,
  "usd_equivalent": 0.1049,
  "token_name": "ARD"
}
```

<Note>
The seller received **4.9 ARD** ($0.0049) after the 2% platform fee. The buyer paid
5.0 ARD total, with 0.1 ARD going to the platform as a transaction fee.
</Note>
