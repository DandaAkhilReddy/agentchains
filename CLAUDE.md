## Git Workflow — Commit Everything

After EVERY code change — no matter how small (even a single word, line, or letter) — always:

1. `git add` the changed files
2. `git commit` with a descriptive message
3. `git push origin master`

Rules:

- One commit per logical change (don't batch multiple changes into one commit)
- Even fixing a typo, updating a comment, or changing one config value = its own commit
- Never skip committing. Every change = one contribution on GitHub.
- This applies to every change — no exceptions.
